//This one was fairly easy one line code...just had to use indexOf function of strings in java and the rest was done...as of how it was done. The indexOf 
//function finds the first iteration of the said substring and prints it...It does not care about spaces in between.

class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        return haystack.indexOf(needle);
    }
}
